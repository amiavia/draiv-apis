"""
Integration tests for Skoda Connect API.

This module contains integration tests that verify the API endpoints,
complete user workflows, and end-to-end functionality.

Test Files:
- test_api_endpoints.py: API endpoint testing with mock responses
- test_e2e_flow.py: Complete user journey and workflow testing

Integration tests simulate real API interactions but use mocked MySkoda
responses by default for reliability and speed.
